# Movie Score Prediction System 
The objective of this Kaggle competition was to implement an ML model which - given a user and a movie - will output the expected rating. We started by conducting a literature review and studying popular approaches such as clustering, content-based filtering, and collaborative filtering. Eventually, we decided to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a matrix factorization technique, and Optuna, an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework. We later explored feature engineering and other NLP techniques to decrease our modelâ€™s root mean squared error (RMSE) score.
