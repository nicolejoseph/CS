# Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis Using BERT
Performed sentiment analysis for multi-class text classification of the AG News dataset, which contains headlines and descriptions for a large set of news articles. I implemented BERT (for tokenizing, and as a pre-trained transformer model) and also performed proper cross validation. Achieved a 94.2% testing accuracy!
