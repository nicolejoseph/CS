# Sentence Parser
For this project, I implemented a sentence parser. This program prompts the user to enter the name of a text file specifying a context free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). After reading the grammar, the program allows the user to enter sentences, one at a time. For each sentence, the program parses it using the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm. Each valid parse is outputted as bracketed notation or as a textual parse tree. 

Shown below is an example sample run of the program.
