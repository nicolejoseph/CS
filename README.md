# Natural Language Processing
Collection of NLP projects completed for my NLP (ECE 467) and DL (ECE472) courses, as well as the BTTAI x Google Kaggle competition. For the Kaggle competition,
my team implemented a movie recommendation system that ranked first in the NY division and in the top 5 out of 27 total team submissions. All code is written in Python.

Explored and implemented concepts such as:
* Text Categorization
* Sentiment Analysis
* Tokenization
* Word Embeddings
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs
